# Overview

The dashboard covers:

# Business Problem 

- AtliQ Grands Hotels, a well-established luxury hotel chain in India, has been facing challenges in recent years due to rising competition and ineffective management decisions, leading to a decline in both market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segments.

- To regain their competitive edge, the management decided to leverage Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Analytics strategies. However, with no in-house analytics team, AtliQ Grands partnered with a third-party analytics provider to analyze their historical data and generate actionable business insights.

- This project is the result of that initiative ‚Äî a Power BI dashboard offering deep insights into revenue performance, booking patterns, and opportunities for business growth.
